# CIScripts
This library contains various helper modules and classes for all my UE5 CI pipelines.

## Usage
This library is designed to operate as a submodule *next* to your scripts.

For example, if you scripts lie inside `(ProjectRoot)/Scripts/CI`, then the submodule path is expected to be `(ProjectRoot)/Scripts/CI/ciscripts`.

## Docs
Basic documentation can be found on [the wiki](https://github.com/AWildErin/ciscripts/wiki).
